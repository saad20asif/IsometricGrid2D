Summary: This assignment is all about realizing about optimization technique(clustering), like in this project clearly we were supposed to interact with only wood tiles 
because we have to place tables vertically and horizontally but only on wood tiles. So we can ignore the rest of the grid and our operations should be in wood tiles like
finding neighbors etc. We can make clusters of wood tiles e.g if there are 6 wood tiles placed together we can bind them in a cluster(Note: there could be multiple clusters in
a grid)
